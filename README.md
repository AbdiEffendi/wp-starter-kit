# Starter-Kit #
## WordPress Plugin Foundation ##

_Starter-Kit_ is a plugin development foundation for rapidly building WordPress plugins.
The framework provides some useful services and a clean way to structure your plugin code.

### What "Problem" is Starter-Kit Supposed Solve? ###

WordPress plugins are an awesome way of adding functionality to your client's WordPress sites. They promise
nice, easily installable nuggets of functionality that you can keep from site to site and even use
to create "value-add" services in your shop -- like adding client branding to the admin, events calendars
or whatever the client can dream up.

The downside is that clients are rarely happy with the catch-all plugin you've built or the one
you built for your last client. Adding option pages are nice, but take time and can rapidly bloat a plugin.
Adding your own action hooks is a start, but can quickly slow down your development effort and are rarely portable
in the end.
